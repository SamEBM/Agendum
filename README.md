# Agendum 📅

_Agendum is a simple React app built with the MERN stack. It is meant to be a place to create and share calendar events with a group of people, so everybody is informed about incoming events. 
Inside the app you are able to read everyone's events, but also create, edit and delete your own events on a calendar UI with multiple views (day, month, agenda)._

_Create an account and give it a try, you can use a fake email if you want to._
